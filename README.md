A javascript compiler for the Shakespeare Programming Language

For more information on SPL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespeare_%28programming_language%29

## FYI

This is for project in my Programming Languages course. I have never written a compiler before, so it will be shaky at best (and hopefully functional) until early next year when I will have formally taken a compiler construction course.
