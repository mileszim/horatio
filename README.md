## FYI

This is a proof-of-concept project for my Programming Languages course. I have never written a compiler before, so it will be shaky at best (and hopefully functional) until early next year when I will have formally taken a compiler construction course.

### What works:

* Very basic single line parsing (can return some output)
* Can scan program, getting acts/scenes
